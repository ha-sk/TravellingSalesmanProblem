# Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

we looked at how to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem using dynamic programming
(TSP). The Bellman-Held-Karp algorithm was used as an illustration of a dynamic
programming approach to solve the TSP problem. After that, we evaluated its performance
against that of other algorithms like branch and bound and brute force.
Our tests revealed that, as compared to brute force and the branch and bound, the dynamic
programming method performed better than both in terms of execution time. Overall, our results
show how well the dynamic programming technique works for solving the TSP and emphasize
the need of taking problem size and algorithm complexity into account when selecting the best
solution.
